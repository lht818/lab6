 There is not much difference between umple code and my code. However, using umple is faster than writing code in java. 
Also, umple cannot do the work when programmer make mistake. it is an advantage 

   The disadvange of using umple is if the progammer make many mistakes filling into the UML diagram, it will be freeze. 
Then, the programer have to start over.
